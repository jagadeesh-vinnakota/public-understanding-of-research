# public-understanding-of-science

The main idea of this project is to assess the public understanding of research by considering the social media discussion about the research

--Data Collection: Data is collected from Altmetrics (https://www.altmetric.com/) where data is in the form of json files. Each json file will have the information like the details about the article and social media discussion about that article.

--Data Cleaning: Here the major concern of data munging was that data was in string format. Data cleaning is done using python.
